## About

We study the ecology and evolution of plantâ€“pathogen interactions, focusing primarily on Arabidopsis thaliana and the bacteria that reside within it. Our approach is interdisciplinary; we draw upon tools from molecular genetics, molecular evolution, computation, field biology, chemistry, and population genetics to understand how ecological interactions shape evolutionary dynamics.

The lab typically contains a mixture of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate students who enjoy working with diverse collaborators from around the world. Many of our field experiments are performed in the Midwest, or abroad, at sites in Sweden and France.
